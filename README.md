##TIMELINE CREATION TOOL

This tool was designed to create a visual representation of events on a timeline. Using PaperJS and a set of mathematical graphing equations, items are placed on the canvas in the order of your choice.

The paper.js code (paperscript) has been minified and injected directly into main.js so that it loads correctly when hosted on gh-pages. If you want to see the paperscript, it is still formatted in 'paper-full.js'.

##Try it out!

When you load the timeline, you're prompted to choose a date-range.  After the timeline is loaded, input a smaller date-range that will be your first event to put on the timeline.

You can also view a pre loaded timeline via the Scifi link, or view the Orbit I made using paper.js.
